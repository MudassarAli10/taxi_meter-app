  "ourStory": "In Casablanca, a tourist named Carla decides to take a taxi to visit the city.\nShe hailed a taxi and eagerly climbed in. The driver, smiling, offered him a price that seemed reasonable. However, he began taking detours, showing her sights while increasing the meter.\nAbsorbed in her stories, Carla did not notice the manipulation.\nUpon arrival, she was surprised by the exorbitant amount.\nWhile chatting with other tourists, she realized she had been scammed.\nDetermined, she decided to share her experience through social networks to warn others and prevent them from falling into the same trap.\n\nThis is where I decided to create Lynaro, a mobile application based on metering algorithms which allow me to give the exact price at the end of each journey.",

  "whatIsLynaro": "What is Lynaro and what is it used for?",
  "whatIsLynaroAnswer": "Lynaro is an application designed to ensure a stress-free taxi journey. Thanks to an integrated counter, it allows you to check the real cost of the journey, thus avoiding frequent scams. It is designed specifically for the Moroccan context, but is also suitable for all those who travel by taxi in other countries.",
  "howDoesTheLynaro": "How does the Lynaro meter work?",
  "howDoesTheLynaroAnswer": "Lynaro's meter uses GPS data to calculate the distance traveled and estimates the cost of the trip based on standard local rates. Simply start the counter at the start of the race and stop it at the end to get an accurate estimate.",
  "whatIsTheBaseMeterPrice": "What is the base meter price?",
  "whatIsTheBaseMeterPriceAnswer": "The base price corresponds to the initial amount displayed by the taxi meter at the start of the trip. For example, in Marrakech, the meter starts at 1.70 DH during the day. This starting price may vary depending on the city and time slots. Lynaro integrates this information to give you an accurate estimate of the cost of your trip.",
  "whatHappensUsingLynaro": "What happens if the driver sees that I'm using Lynaro?",
  "whatHappensUsingLynaroAnswer": "A taxi is required by law to use its own meter. If his meter does not work, then he legally cannot work. If the driver refuses to allow you to use Lynaro during the trip, this may indicate that he intends to charge you an unjustified fare. Lynaro is here to ensure complete transparency and protect your rights as a passenger. If the driver has nothing to hide, he will have no problem using the application",
  "isLynaroAvailableInAllCities": "Is Lynaro available in all cities in Morocco?",
  "isLynaroAvailableInAllCitiesAnswer": "Yes, Lynaro is available in all cities in Morocco. Whether you are in Casablanca, Marrakech, Tangier, Rabat or any other city, the application works to help you estimate the cost of your taxi trips. We are committed to providing a consistent and reliable experience, no matter where you are.",
  "errorMessage": "Please enter a valid price \n(e.g., 1.70, 2.00)."
