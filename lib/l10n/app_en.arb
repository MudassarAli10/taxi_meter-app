  "ourStory": "In the vibrant city of Casablanca, a tourist named Carla set out to explore. Eager to see the sights, she hailed a cab and trusted the smiling driver. However, as the driver took detours and turned up the meter, Carla found herself lost in stories instead of landmarks. Upon arrival, the fare was shockingly high, and she realized she'd been overcharged.\n\nDetermined to help others avoid similar experiences, Carla shared her story on social media, sparking a call for transparency. Inspired by this, we created Lynaroâ€”a mobile app that calculates the exact fare for each journey, ensuring honesty and fair pricing in Morocco's taxis.",
